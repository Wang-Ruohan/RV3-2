(energetic light rock music)

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,790
- I would like to show how easy it is

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,629
to install a CUI AMT encoder.

4
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:12,378
First, take the spacer wrench
and place it over the shaft.

5
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:17,410
Select the proper sleeve
to fit the shaft size,

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,934
and press it down tight,
against the wrench.

7
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:24,961
Take the shaft adapter, and
press it on over the sleeve.

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:30,233
Use the centering tool,
to press it down tight.

9
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:32,924
Once that is snapped into place,

10
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,863
you can remove the spacer wrench.

11
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:39,057
Next, we'll need to take
the mounting bracket

12
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:44,960
and center it over the shaft adapter

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,317
using the centering tool.

14
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:50,332
At which point, we can screw it in place.

15
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:54,093
Now that the mounting plate
is secured and centered,

16
00:00:54,093 --> 00:01:00,755
simply snap in your CUI AMT encoder

17
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:02,085
and it's ready to use.

18
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:06,939
CUI's AMT encoder series includes AMT10,

19
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,628
AMT11,

20
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,668
AMT20,

21
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,617
AMT31.

22
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:15,817
All of which can be found at digikey.com.

23
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:16,908
Thanks for watching.
