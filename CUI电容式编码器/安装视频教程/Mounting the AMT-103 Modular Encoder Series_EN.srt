00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,638
installation tutorial where we'll

4
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,558
outline the steps required to accurately

5
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:15,560
mount an AMT encoder onto a motor

[Music]

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,429
begin by inserting tool a as a spacer

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,960
that defines the distance to the

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,778
mounting surface slide the appropriate

10
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,689
size sleeve onto the shaft and all the

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,619
way down to two La slide the shaft

12
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,628
adapter over the sleeve

13
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,448
use Tulsi to press the shaft adapter

14
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,549
over the sleeve until it is flush with

[Music]

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,560
use Tulsi as a centering tool for

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,450
mounting the AMT base onto the motor

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:10,310
[Music]

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,040
carefully engage the groove in Tulsi to

carefully observing that the teeth of

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,349
the shaft adapter aligned with the

33
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,239
grooves in the hub

34
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,799

make sure the snaps are fully engaged

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:16,169
and the top covers flush with a base

37
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,449
align the lip on the reverse side of

38
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,550
Tulsi with the opening on the top cover

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,310

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,439
the front of the top government when

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,389
installation is finished the shaft

42
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,699
adapter sleeve and rotor hub should all

43
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,229
be recessed slightly from the front of

44
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,879
the encoder with the motor shaft

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:43,349
